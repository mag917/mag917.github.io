	<h3>Thoughts On "The Future"</h3>
    <header><strong>A somewhat scatter-brained response to <a href "https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/">As We May Think"</a> and <a href ="http://oldobjectsnewideas.com/_reading/Berners-Lee_LongLiveWeb2010.pdf">Long Live The Web"</a></strong></header>

    	<p>As an avid fan of science fiction, I have often lamented the fact that although we live in "The Future", I still can't do many of the things sci-fi said we'd be able to do by now, like go to the moon or catch a ride in a flying taxi. According to Back To The Future 2, I should've been able to walk into a Toys R Us and pick up a hoverboard five years ago, but now in 2020 not only do hoverboards not exist, Toys R Us doesn't either. Yet at the same time, I have a 3D Printer, the closest thing to Star Trek's replicators we have so far, and it cost less than either of my guitars. Predicting the future is a tricky business, and that makes it all the more impressive when someone gets something right.</p>

		<p>When Vannevar Bush wrote "As We May Think", ENIAC, the first electronic general-purpose computer, had not yet been finished, and yet he managed to predict something somewhat close to Wikipedia, though the details of its operation are way off. There was no way he could've predicted the invention of the transistor, which would be the foundation of all our modern computer technology, but in his description of the "memex", the proto-hypertext system that he envisioned, he predicted an electronic encyclopedia with links between articles much like Wikipedia.  Of course he spoke of it in terms a citizen of the year 1945 could understand, in terms of levers and vacuum tubes rather than of mouse clicks and transistors, but the basic idea is there</p>

		<p>
		"As We May Think" came out of Vannevar Bush's concern for the scientific community's focus on inventing new methods of destruction instead of gaining new understanding the world around us. Similarly, Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the Web, expresses his concerns for the future of the Web, and by extension, the future of the world at large. Despite its great potential for good, it has been misused in various ways. It can be used for misinformation as easily as it can be used for factual information. Richard Feynman once said "To every [human] is given the key to the gates of heaven. The same key opens the gates of hell. And so it is with science" And so it is with the Web, as well.
