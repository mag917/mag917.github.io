    <h2>This is a test page. The text is not mine, it's from <a href="https://kotaku.com/untitled-goose-game-the-kotaku-review-1838264644" >here</a>. I needed some text to test with and I felt an actual game review would work better than Lorem Ipsum.</h2>
    <div class="article" style="color:white;"> <p class = "vanish10" >The way Untitled Goose Game’s goose moves, I think, is what makes it so endearing. Its self-assured waddle. The way it leans its feathered neck forward, with an almost innocent inquisitiveness, before turning on some poor guy’s sprinklers and drenching him. How it flaps and flutters after its plans have been thwarted by a human, only to immediately compose itself and clap back with a look that says, “Actually, I’m the one who should be feeling offended after you took back the priceless vase I stole from you and was planning to shatter into a million pieces.” The goose is a piece of <span class="vanish1" >shit</span>. I love the goose.</p></div> 

    <div class="article" style="color:white;">
    <p>Untitled Goose Game became a phenomenon long before its release today for PC and Switch. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQknBJo4aBQ">2017 pre-alpha trailer</a>, which depicted a goose messing with a groundskeeper whose blood pressure will probably never recover, tapped into something essential and primal: Geese are <span class="vanish1">assholes</span>. They’re equal parts haughty and inscrutably mean. They while away their days performing mundane acts of domestic terrorism—blocking paths, honking angrily at anyone who dares approach them, and just generally displaying a smug, unearned confidence. The power fantasy underlying Untitled Goose Game is a tantalizing if dark glimpse into the most remote recesses of the psyche. What, the game asks, if the bullied (humanity) became the bully (a lone goose)?</p></div>

    <p class = "flip">The result is a chill mashup of sandbox-y stealth and puzzling. You, the goose, are turned loose in a series of small town environments, including the aforementioned groundskeeper’s garden, a storefront, a tavern, and some neighbors’ backyard. Each environment seamlessly flows together, but you’ve got to complete most (though not all) objectives on a list before you can move on to the next. Objectives, you will not be shocked to learn, center around ruining people’s days.</p> </div>
