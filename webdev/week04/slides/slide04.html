			The original X-Wing design had semicircular engine intakes, which didn't make it into the Original Trilogy but was brought back for the sequels.<br>
			The Y-Wing's exposed mechanical parts hint at the idea that some armor plating had been removed to save weight and increase top speed. <br> This was inspired by classic American hot rods, which had body panels removed for the same reasons.
