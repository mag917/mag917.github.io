	<p class="centered">
	George Lucas, in the early drafts of the script for Star Wars, only described Vader as having a flowing black cloak and a samurai-esque helmet.<br> It was Ralph McQuarrie's idea to give him the iconic mask and breathing device. as he was shown jumping between ships in these early drafts. <br>
	The whole "jumping between ships" didn't make it into the movies, but he DID ride on top of his Tie Fighter in one of the animated TV shows.
